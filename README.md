 5-DOF Robotic Arm Design using Tinkercad

 🧩 Project Overview
This is a 3D mechanical design of a robotic arm with five degrees of freedom (5 DOF), created entirely using Tinkercad. The focus of this project is on the structural and joint design of the arm without any electronics or programming components.

 🛠️ Tools Used
- Tinkercad (for 3D modeling)
- 5 mechanical joints representing each degree of freedom
- Rotating base and arm segments
- Simple gripper (end effector)

 🔍 Model Description
- Base: A circular base allowing horizontal rotation (1 DOF)
- Lower Arm: Connected to the base and moves vertically (2 DOF)
- Upper Arm: Moves independently from the lower arm (3 DOF)
- Wrist Joint: Provides additional angular movement (4 DOF)
- Gripper: Designed to open and close to hold objects (5 DOF)

📌 Notes
- This design is ideal as an educational prototype for understanding robotic arm mechanics.
- The project can be extended later by adding motors and Arduino-based control systems.
